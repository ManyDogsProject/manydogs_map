# ManyDogs Project Site Map

We use the R packages [plotly](https://plotly-r.com) (adapting the Python package [plotly](https://plotly.com/)) and [maps](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps) to generate an interactive map of the sites active in the [ManyDogs Project](https://manydogsproject.github.io/).

Hover over dots to see site names, and zoom and drag map to explore site locations more closely.
